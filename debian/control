Description: the crypto undertaker
 Derived from the dyne:bolic nesting mechanism, Tomb is a free and
 easy to operate desktop application for fairly strong encryption of
 personal files. A tomb is like a locked folder that can be
 transported and hidden in filesystems; its keys are password
 protected and can be kept separate, for instance keeping a tomb file
 in your computer's harddisk and its key file on a USB stick.
 Tomb relies on dm-crypt (and cryptsetup) as an encryption backend
 using the aes-cbc-essiv:sha256 cypher.
