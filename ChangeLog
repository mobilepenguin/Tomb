Nov 2011 - 1.2
	Includes an Important fix to password parsing for spaces and
	extended chars, plus a new 'passwd' command to change a key's
	password. Tomb now checks for swap to avoid its usage (see SWAP
	section in manpage) and warns the user when the tomb is almost
	full.

May 2011 - 1.1
	Fixes to mime types, icons and desktop integration. A new 'list'
	command provides an overview on all tombs currently open. Now a
	tomb cannot be mounted multiple times, the message console has
	colors and better messages. Different mount options (like
	read-only) can also be specified by hand on the commandline.

March 2011 - 1.0

	Clean and stable. Now passwords are handled exclusively using
	pinentry. Also support for steganography of keys (bury and exhume)
	was added to the commandline. Commandline and desktop operations
	are well separated so that tomb can be used via remote terminal. A
	new command 'slam' immediately closes a tomb killing all processes
	that keep it busy.

February 2011 - 0.9.2

	The tomb-open wizard now correctly guides you through the creation
	of new tombs and helps when saving the keys on external USB
	storage devices. The status tray now reliably closes its tomb.

February 2011 - 0.9.1

	Sourcecode cleanup, debugging and testing.
	Integrated some feedback after filing Debian's ITP and RFS.

January 2011 - 0.9

	Tomb is now a desktop application following freedesktop standards:
	it provides a status tray and integrates with file managers.  The
	main program has been thoroughly tested and many bugs were fixed.

August 2010

	The first usable version of Tomb goes public among hacker friends

During the year 2009

	Tomb has been extensively tested, perfectioned and documented
	after being used by its author

Sometime in 2007

	mknest was refactored to work on the Debian distribution and since
	then renamed to Tomb. dyne:bolic specific dependencies where
	removed, keeping Zsh as the shell script it is written with.

Back in 2005

	The "nesting" feature of dyne:bolic GNU/Linux lets users encrypt
	their home in a file, using a shell script and a graphical
	interface called Taschino.

	Taschino included a shell script wrapping cryptsetup to encrypt
	loopback mounted partitions with the algo AES-256 (cbc-essiv
	mode): this script was called 'mkNest' and its the ancestor of
	Tomb.
