Critical bugfix

The previous version of Tomb had a critical bug: passwords containing
odd characters where badly interpreted and split at spaces. This means
that if you password was ‘I am 12!! perfectly 7^!@^#38123 secure' it
has been understood by tomb as simply ‘I’ being split at the first
“odd” character. So even if you thought you have a long pass-phrase,
instead it might have happened that you were using a single character
one.

Now this bug has been fixed. However, it won’t fix the password for
the tomb that you created and used so far: you need to change the
password using the new command 'tomb passwd'.
